# GitHub Workshop repository  

## About this Repository

This repository is setup to enable community members of the DSWB project use and familiarise themselves with GitHub.

Feel free to try out as many things as possible. You won't be breaking anything, and we'd be available to help out if you need help.

Please tag Precious Onyewuchi (@preshh0) to help you out if you're confused.
